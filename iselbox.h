// iselbox.h : an independent class encapsulating functions needed for a
//				selection box in the interactive graphics application.
//
// Creation : Feb. 11th 2011
// revision : 
//  @Feb. 12th 2011 
//			adjust into an independent class from the
//			original CGLApp inheritance for the purpose of the support of
//			multiple-box selection
//	@Feb. 19th 2011
//			evolution into intuitive user-oriented box selection, with
//			resistance to modeling and viewing transformations
//	@Feb. 21th 2011
//			1.upgrade the front-facing judgement algorithm to what is suggested
//			in the redBook of openGL, and make the decision more correct and
//			reliable
//			2.interaction for the face movement on the selection box perfected
//			3.whole selection box moving interaction added, following the same
//			idea for the same interaction applied towards the whole object:
//			 - mouse dragging with right button for translation along X/Y axis
//			 - combined with CTRL+Right_Mouse_Button for translating along Z-axis,
//	@Feb. 22th 2011
//			1. add hint for the currently front facing faces of the selection
//			box
//			2. when mouse moving over a selectable (front facing) face, further
//			cueing the user by filling the polygon translucently.
//			3. fix the glitch in the selection stretching : while face 1,3
//			rotated to be upwards or downwards, or face 2,4 to be leftwards or
//			rightwards,the movement of mouse does not match the desirable
//			stretching of the faces intuitively. Fixing by following the same
//			idea for face 0 and 5.
//			4. add limit on the selection stretching : forbidding a movement
//			intending to push or pull a face over its opposite one, which is
//			meaningless in most cases and absurd in the box selection
//			interaction especially.
//	@Feb. 23th 2011
//			1. Make an uniform and smoother movement in the selection box
//			stretching by calculating the difference of object coordinates
//			"Unprojected" from the mouse window coordinate rather than the
//			original mouse vector length as used before
//			2. the very initial selection stretching is changed to be driven by
//			the movement along the Y axis rathen than X axis as was before, this
//			should perfect the interaction by making it further intuitive
//			3. add limit on the selection stretching : forbidding a movement
//			that will lead the focused face to go beyond the window
//			4. add a switch for the selection box sketching/moving limit
//			control, when it is off, the abrupt, maybe faster in other users'
//			view, movement will be resumed by using the mouse vector length
//			again.
//			5. add a switch for the front facing hint. When users prefer to
//			better performance, they might want to turn off this gaudy feature
// @Feb. 25th 2011
//			1. add a default axis orientation gadget
//			2. change the front facing hint filling color to grey
// @Feb. 26th 2011
//			1. place a more rigid limit control on the box stretching by
//			detecting if the focused face has any of its vertices in window
//			coordinate got outside the viewport, rather than simply checking if
//			the mouse click goes beyond the viewport as previously adopted
<<<<<<< HEAD
// @Mar. 8th 2011
//			1.in order to make the behaviour of m_pcout controllable as m_cout
//			in its hosting container CGLIBoxApp, change this pointer to a plain
//			MyCout instance; the properties of it will be force to conformed
//			to that of CGLIBoxApp::m_cout when a CIselbox object is added to its
//			container, a CGLIBoxApp object
